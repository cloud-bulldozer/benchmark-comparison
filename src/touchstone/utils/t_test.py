# is_regression.py - statistical test for performance throughput regression
# based on python scipy.stats.ttest_ind() function
#
# we input two sets of samples: 
#  the baseline sample set -- used as an indication of previously achieved level of performance
#  the current sample set -- used as an indication of the system currently being tested for performance regression
#
# command line inputs:
#  sample_type -- 'throughput' or 'response-time'
#  confidence_threshold -- min probability that two sample sets have a different mean 
#                           (e.g. 95 means that results differ with 95% probability)
#  max_pct_dev -- maximum percent deviation of either sample set, 100.0 x std.dev/mean 
#  regression_threshold -- do not return error status unless regression exceeds this percentage
#  base_sample -- file containing baseline performance throughput samples, 1 per line
#  current_sample -- file containing current performance throughput samples, 1 per line
#
# environment variable inputs:
#  USE_TTEST - if defined, use T-test, else use Mann-Whitney U test
#
# recommendation: make max_pct_dev 1/2 of regression threshold, so that you can detect small regressions.
#
# return status codes and their meanings are described below in the code.
#  
# we declare a performance regression if base_set mean is worse than current_set mean and a T-test determines
# that the probability that the two sample sets have a different mean is greater than confidence_threshold
#
# the base sample set mean is "worse" than the current sample set mean if and only if:
#   the sample_type is 'throughput'    and the base mean > current mean
#   the sample type is 'response-time' and the base mean < current mean
